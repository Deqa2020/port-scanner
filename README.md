> Copy that code into your **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** editor and follow the instructions below to run it.



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**  
   Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. **Install Python Extension in VS Code**  
   - Open VS Code  
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + X`  
   - Search for `Python` and install the one by Microsoft

3. **Create the Script File**  
   - Open a new file in VS Code  
   - Copy the Python code from the bottom of this README  
   - Save the file as `port_scanner.py`

4. **Open the Terminal**  
   - Click on `Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal`  
   - Or press `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick)

5. **Navigate to the Script Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/script

  6 Run the Script:
  
      python port_scanner.py
7 Enter the Target Information:

    Enter target IP address or domain: 192.168.1.155
    Enter starting port: 20
    Enter ending port: 100

8 View the Results

The script will show which ports are open and how long the scan took.

üß™ Example Output

    Enter target IP address or domain: 192.168.1.155
    Enter starting port: 20
    Enter ending port: 100
    Starting scan on 192.168.1.155
    Scanning ports 20 to 100...

    [+] Port 22 is open
    [+] Port 80 is open

    Scan completed in: 0:00:01.234567
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational purposes only. 


Do not scan devices or networks you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

‚úÖ Always scan your own computer or network.

üí° To find your own IP address on Windows, open Command Prompt and run:

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| **Issue**             | **Solution**                                                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No output**         | No services are running on those ports ‚Äî try a different target or range. |
| **Python not found**  | Install Python or check your system's PATH variable.                |
| **Ports always closed**| Check if firewall or antivirus is blocking connections.            |
