üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting


Issue                       | Solution
No output                   | No services running on those ports; try another target or port range.
Python not found            | Install Python or check PATH variable.
Ports always closed         | Check if the firewall is blocking connections or ports are just closed.



‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Do not use it to scan networks or devices that you do not own or do not have permission to scan.

‚úÖ Always scan your own computer or network.

üí° To find your IP address on Windows, open Command Prompt and type:

ipconfig

Use the IP shown under IPv4 Address to scan your own machine.

For example: I used this tool to scan my HP laptop on my home network.

üîê Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and may violate terms of service. Use responsibly.
